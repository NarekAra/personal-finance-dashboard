# Personal Finance Dashboard ðŸ‘‹

**Take Control of Your Finances.**

This is a Streamlit application that provides a comprehensive dashboard for visualizing and analyzing personal finance data. The application allows users to upload their transaction data (e.g., from a bank statement) and generates interactive visualizations and insights based on the data.

## Pages

### Categorizer
The Categorizer allows users to categorize their financial transactions by uploading transaction data and a configuration file. It automatically assigns categories and subcategories based on the provided rules, displays the categorized transactions in an interactive grid, and enables users to manually edit or download the categorized data.

### Dashboard
The Dashboard lets users upload transaction data from excel files. It displays balance trends over time for different sources such as bank accounts and credit cards using graphs and tiles. It also provides insights into spending per category using bar graphs. Additionally, users can set financial goals, like limiting travel expenses, and track their progress with a heatmap.

The application's behavior and settings can be customized the dasboard settings.
