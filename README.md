# Personal Finance Dashboard ðŸ‘‹

**Take Control of Your Finances.**

This is a Streamlit application that provides a comprehensive dashboard for visualizing and analyzing personal finance data. The application allows users to upload their transaction data (e.g., from a bank statement) and generates interactive visualizations and insights based on the data.

## Pages

### Categorizer
The Categorizer allows users to categorize their financial transactions by uploading transaction data and a configuration file. It automatically assigns categories and subcategories based on the provided rules, displays the categorized transactions in an interactive grid, and enables users to manually edit or download the categorized data.

### Dashboard
The Dashboard lets users upload transaction data from Excel files. It displays balance trends over time for different sources such as bank accounts and credit cards using graphs and tiles. It also provides insights into spending per category using bar graphs. Additionally, users can set financial goals, like limiting travel expenses, and track their progress with a heatmap.

The application's behavior and settings can be customized the dasboard settings.

## Logging in
Logging in provides the benefit of saving the user's data in the database. Therefore you won't have to upload your data every time you open the application.

## Roadmap (not in order)
- [x] Allow users to log in (firebase)
- [x] Instead of providing a .yml config, allow users to do this through the UI (subject to users being able to log in)
- [ ] Figure out if it is plausible to get data from banks API, not through an excel.
- [ ] Can GPT help with categorization?
- [ ] Other plots? Let users choose their own plots? Make it more modular.
- [ ] Make the UI more consistant (e.g. colours)
- [ ] Make seperate dashboard to keep track of investments
- [ ] Allow users to add assets (not only cash-flow) like real-estate
- [ ] Allow users to keep track of their debt
- [ ] Look forward: projected income/outcome in the future
- [ ] Allow users to chat with their transactions
- [x] Make the firebase optional to use this repo
- ...
